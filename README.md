# OptimizedGASDemo

## Overview

OptimizedGASDemo is an Unreal Engine project created from the Third Person C++ template, focused on implementing and optimizing the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) inspired by the Lyra project. This project serves as a challenge to research and apply GAS effectively for character abilities, damage/attribute systems, and core combat mechanics. The goal is to create an extensible framework for advanced gameplay features while optimizing performance for smooth, realistic interactions.

## Features

### Gameplay Ability System (GAS) (In Development)

-   Deep research and implementation of GAS based on Lyra.
-   Optimized and extensible design for Character Abilities and Damage/Attribute System.
-   Seamless integration with Unreal Engine's GAS framework.

### Character Experience (In Development)

-   Enhanced Character Control for smooth and realistic third-person gameplay.
-   Improvements to address limitations, ensuring fluid movement and interaction.

### Core Combat System (In Development)

-   Effective Weapon Tracing implementation.
-   Damage calculation system powered by GAS for accurate and dynamic combat.

### Nice to Have (Target Lock System) (In Development)

-   Lock Camera (Target Lock System) for improved targeting and combat engagement.

## Roadmap

-   **Phase 1: GAS Foundation** - Research and implement basic GAS setup inspired by Lyra, including core components and integration.
-   **Phase 2: Character Abilities and Attributes** - Develop extensible character abilities and damage/attribute systems using GAS.
-   **Phase 3: Combat Mechanics** - Implement weapon tracing and dynamic damage calculations for core combat.
-   **Phase 4: Enhancements** - Add target lock system, polish character controls, and optimize for smooth third-person gameplay.

## Requirements

-   Unreal Engine 5.7 (or compatible version)
-   Windows 64-bit platform
-   Visual Studio 2022 (for C++ development)

## Technologies Used

-   **Unreal Engine 5.7**: Core game engine for development.
-   **C++**: Primary programming language for performance-critical components.
-   **Blueprint**: Visual scripting for rapid prototyping and UI.
-   **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**: Framework for abilities, attributes, and combat logic.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `OptimizedGASDemo.uproject` file with Unreal Engine 5.7.
3. Build the project using the provided build tasks (e.g., "OptimizedGASDemoEditor Win64 Development Build").
4. Launch the editor to explore and test the features.

## Usage

-   [ ] **Character Abilities**: Use GAS to define and trigger abilities for characters.
-   [ ] **Damage System**: Experience dynamic damage calculations during combat.
-   [ ] **Weapon Tracing**: Test effective weapon interactions in combat scenarios.
-   [ ] **Target Lock**: Enable and use the camera lock system for targeted gameplay.
